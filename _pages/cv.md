## Publications

**Beyond Patches: Global-aware Autoregressive Model for Multimodal Few-Shot Font Generation**  
*CVPR 2026 Submission (Under Review)*  
[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01593)

- Proposed **GAR-Font**, a global-aware autoregressive framework that models font generation beyond patch-level representations.
- Designed **a global-aware tokenizer (G-Tok)** and a **lightweight multimodal style encoder**, enabling holistic font modeling and flexible text-guided control from few references.
- Introduced **a post-training refinement pipeline** with LoRA-based NFA and GRPO-based SE to further improve global style faithfulness structural fidelity.

**MMMG: A Massive, Multidisciplinary, Multi-Tier Generation Benchmark for Text-to-Image Reasoning**  
*NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track*  
[Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10963)

- Introduced **Knowledge Image Generation** as a new evaluation task
- Built **a large-scale benchmark** spanning 10 disciplines and 6 educational levels
- Contributed to data collection, annotation protocol design, quality control, and baseline evaluation
