I am an undergraduate student at **Peking University**, majoring in **Information and Computing Science**.  My research focuses on **computer vision**, **image synthesis**, and **multimodal learning**. I am passionate about bridging theoretical advances with practical applications, exploring how AI can interpret, generate, and reason over complex visual and multimodal data.  
I actively engage in research projects involving **image synthesis**, **multimodal understanding and generation**, and **post-training for visual generative models**. Through these projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of both the theoretical foundations and practical challenges of modern AI, while honing skills in model design, experimentation, and problem-solving. I am always eager to collaborate on innovative research and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of visual intelligence and multimodal learning.
